## Introduction

A ConfigMap is a Kubernetes object that allows you to store configuration data separately from your application code. It provides a way to decouple configuration from the application, making it easier to manage and update configurations without redeploying the application.

This repository contains the following files:

- `configmap.yaml`: The YAML file that defines the ConfigMap.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Modify the `configmap.yaml` file according to your application's configuration needs.

3. Apply the ConfigMap to your Kubernetes cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml
    ```

4. In your application code, reference the ConfigMap values using environment variables or configuration libraries.
