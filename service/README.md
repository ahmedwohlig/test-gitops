# Service Module

This module contains the code and configuration for the service component in the GitOps repository.

## Overview

The service module is responsible for deploying and managing the service component of the application using GitOps practices. It ensures that the desired state of the service is defined in the Git repository and automatically applied to the target environment using ARGOCD.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the service module, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- ARGOCD installed and configured
- Access to the GitOps repository

## Usage

To deploy the service module, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitOps repository:

    ```shell
    git clone <gitops-repo-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the service module directory:

    ```shell
    cd service
    ```

3. Modify the configuration files according to your requirements.

4. Commit and push the changes to the GitOps repository:

    ```shell
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update service configuration"
    git push origin main
    ```

5. ARGOCD will automatically detect the changes and apply them to the target environment.
